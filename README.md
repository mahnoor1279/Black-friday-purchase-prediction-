# Black-friday-purchase-prediction-
Hello there it is my first project in Github ,so apologize in advance if there is any mistake and i did something wrong.
So I have choosen dataset of 'Black Friday'. First I'll explain that what is the business problem behind this. 
This data is related to the Retail shopping , as they want to predict that how much their customers will do purchasing , as they have provided 'train.csv' dataset for working and then they also provide the details of the 'test.csv' dataset (Note: In 'test.csv' did not contain th purchase column) 
So this problem is basically related to th 'Regression ' problem .
